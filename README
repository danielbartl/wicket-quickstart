Type "gradle build" in order to build the wicket quickstart project with Gradle.

Type "gradle jettyRun" in order to start the quickstart wicket app in Jetty.

Include the following line into your .bash_profile script (or according one for your system):

export GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.daemon=true"

in order to execute Gradle while using so called Gradle Deamon
(a Java process that constantly runs in the background and executes builds on Gradleâ€™s behalf).
It will make your build significantly faster.

For more details about Gradle see http://www.gradle.org!

In case you don't have Gradle already installed on your system you can use provided Gradle Wrapper.
If you run Gradle with ./gradlew, Gradle checks if a Gradle distribution for the wrapper is available.
If not it tries to download it, otherwise it delegates to the gradle command of this distribution with all the
arguments passed originally to the gradlew command.

The gradlew command can be used exactly the same way as the gradle command.
