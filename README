Type "gradle build" in order to build the wicket quickstart project with Gradle.

Type "gradle jettyRun" in order to start the quickstart wicket app in Jetty.

Include the following line into your .bash_profile script (or according one for your system):

export GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.daemon=true"

in order to execute Gradle while using so called Gradle Deamon
(a Java process that constantly runs in the background and executes builds on Gradleâ€™s behalf).
It will make your build significantly faster.

For more details about Gradle see http://www.gradle.org!
